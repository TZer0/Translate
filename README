qmake the .pro-file and make to compile.

This is a simple program for reading a map, add a bunch of tags to said map and then save that map. It was made to show variations of words across languages.

Instructions:
1. Add languages.
2. Add words, to add relatives of a word in other and the same language, double-click that word, then add words.
3. Adjust the position of the tags using the x and y-fields per language.
4. Load a map-file (if you are using the same map over and over again, then skip this step after the first time).
5. Select words you want to include (high-light one per window)
6. Hit Generate Map
7. Save

On Windows the settings are stored in:
%USER%\appdata\roaming\TZer0\translate.ini
On Linux:
${HOME}/.config/TZer0/translate.ini
On Mac... I have no idea, probably same as Linux.

Known issue:
You can add duplicate words to a group of relatives within a language - these words disappear when you restart the program.
